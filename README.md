# A simple RISC-V CPU in SystemVerilog (single cycle and pipeline two version)

## Single Cycle Architecture

![sample ISA](./assets/SampleISA.png)

Here is the basic architecture including instruction memory, register file, ALU, and data memory.
![arch basic](./assets/archbasic.png)

- `bne`: MUX for the PC target
- `r-type`: MUX for result source
![arch R type](./assets/archR.png)


Control unit is composed of a main decoder and an ALU decoder.

The truth table of the main decoder is like:

|Instruction | Op | RegWrite | ImmSrc | ALUSrc | MemWrite | ResultSrc | Branch | ALUOp
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lw        | 0000011   |   1   |   00  |   1   |   0   |   1   |   0   |   00  |
| sw        | 0100011   |   0   |   01  |   1   |   #   |   x   |   0   |   00  |
| R-type    | 0110011   |   1   |   xx  |   0   |   0   |   0   |   0   |   10  |
| beq       | 1100011   |   0   |   10  |   0   |   0   |   x   |   1   |   01  |

## Pipeline Architecture

![arch Pipeline](./assets/archPipeline.png)


Here is the abstract view illustrating hazards and solving it with NOPs.
![hazard](./assets/hazard.png)

### Forwarding
The forwarding also called bypassing.
![forwarding](./assets/forwarding.png)
![forwarding](./assets/archforwarding.png)

### Stall
This unused stage propagating through the pipeline is called a bubble.
stalling a stage is performed by disabling its pipeline register (i.e., the register to the left of a stage) so that the stageâ€™s inputs do not change.
The pipeline register directly after the stalled stage must be cleared (flushed).
